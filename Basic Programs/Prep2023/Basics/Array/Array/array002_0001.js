// Question:
// Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns the length of the longest strictly increasing subarray. A strictly increasing subarray is a subarray in which the elements are arranged in strictly increasing order without any repetition. If there are no strictly increasing subarrays in the array, the program should return 0.

// Sample Input 1:
// Array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6]

// Sample Output 1:
// Length of the longest strictly increasing subarray = 3

// Explanation:
// The longest strictly increasing subarray in the given array is [2, 5, 7]. This subarray has a length of 3, and it is strictly increasing without any repetition.

// Sample Input 2:
// Array = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

// Sample Output 2:
// Length of the longest strictly increasing subarray = 0
